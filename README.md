# QProcessInfo
Quick Qt class to enumerate running processes on a system

# Building
Should just be able to drop into any Qt project and go, it deliberately doesn't have any dependencies that shouldn't already be there (entirely Qt code on unix, only kernel32.dll on windows).

# License
2-clause BSD license. Go hog wild!
